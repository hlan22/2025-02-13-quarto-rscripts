# Quarto Documents

Notes from my DSCI 310 lecture on Thursday, February 13th, 2025.

The main idea we learned was about quarto documents and how you can use them.
Later on in the semester we will learn further about making your own websites with quarto documents, or even a powerpoint or textbook.

Since I already have a lot of knowledge about quarto documents, I won't list everything we went over in class. 
However, I will note some interesting things:

- You should generally exclude any rendered documents from quarto because those are often seen as "visual noise"
- There are many different ways of rendering code blocks
- HTML is generally better for visuals and customizations than something like a PDF
- Quarto documents can be made into a lot more than just PDFs or HTML files
- etc.
